# Intrusive Thoughts Generator üéØ

## Basic Details
### Team Name: MightCompile

### Project Description
Ever looked at a coffee stain and thought it looked like a dragon? Or seen faces in the clouds? This project turns that delightful human tendency to find patterns into an AI-powered storytelling adventure! We take any image, extract its interesting patterns, and let AI weave creative tales about what it "sees."

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
People are spending too much time being productive and not enough time finding stories in random patterns! Why should cloud-watching be limited to actual clouds? What about the epic tales hidden in your coffee stains, crumpled papers, or random photographs?

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We built an AI-powered "Professional Pattern Storyteller" that:
1. Takes any image and finds interesting patterns in it
2. Transforms these patterns into high-contrast white lines on a black background
3. Uses Groq AI to create whimsical stories about what it sees
4. Engages in a playful conversation about the details it noticed

It's like having a creative writing partner who's always ready to turn mundane patterns into magical stories!

## Technical Details
### Technologies Used
- **Python**: Core programming language
- **OpenCV (cv2)**: Image processing and pattern detection
- **Streamlit**: Web interface and user interaction
- **Groq AI**: Creative story generation
- **PIL (Python Imaging Library)**: Image handling
- **NumPy**: Numerical operations for image processing
- **python-dotenv**: Environment variable management

### Key Components
1. **Image Processing** (`image_cleaning.py`):
   - Converts images to grayscale
   - Applies Gaussian blur for noise reduction
   - Detects edges using Canny algorithm
   - Creates high-contrast contour images

2. **Story Generation** (`groq_interpretation.py`):
   - Processes images for AI interpretation
   - Crafts detailed prompts for the AI
   - Generates creative stories and conversations

3. **User Interface** (`main.py`):
   - Handles image uploads
   - Manages the application flow
   - Displays results in an engaging format

### Implementation

The project follows a multi-stage pipeline to transform ordinary images into engaging stories:

#### 1. Image Processing Pipeline
First, we process the input image using OpenCV to extract meaningful patterns:

#### 2. Contour Enhancement
We create a high-contrast visualization of the detected patterns:
- Generate a black background
- Draw white contours for maximum visibility
- Apply slight dilation to make lines more prominent
- Save as a clean, binary image

#### 3. Story Generation with Groq
We use Llama model through Groq's API for creative interpretation:
- Convert the processed image to base64
- Craft a detailed prompt that guides the AI to:
  - Observe actual patterns in the image
  - Create stories based on visible shapes
  - Generate natural conversations about details
- Process the response into a structured format

#### 4. User Interface
We used streamlit to provide an intuitive flow:
1. Image upload and preview
2. One-click processing
3. Display of:
   - Original image
   - Detected patterns
   - Generated story
   - Interactive conversation

#### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Groq API key
- OpenCV

#### Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/AsherWood39/TinkerHub_Useless_Project_2_0.git

# Navigate to project directory
cd TinkerHub_Useless_Project_2_0

# Create and activate virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # For Linux/Mac
# or
.\venv\Scripts\activate  # For Windows

# Install requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set up environment variables
# Create a .env file and add your Groq API key:
echo "GROQ_API_KEY=your_key_here" > .env
```

#### Run the Application
```bash
streamlit run main.py
```
